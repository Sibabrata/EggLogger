Instructions:
1. Download the code from git repository.
2. Import the code to your eclipse IDE.
3. Click on Run as TestNG.
4. Verify the output in under test output folder.
5. Click on index.html file to verify the results.

Include any platform limitations:
1. This code will only run on chrome 85 version.
2. I have added the code for FireFox as well for that please add gecko driver

Improvements:

1. Listeners could have been used for better logs.
2. Extent Reports could also have been used for better reporting User Interface.
3. The whole test suite could also have been configured in jenkins for automatic scheduling.
